# keep to using attr_reader

##

you need to keep an eye on strings, arrays & hashes.

There are methods that will change these objects:

Most methods ending in ! (like gsub!)
delete
update
clear
shift / unshift / pop / push
The first step is to be aware of these methods.

If you have to use one of these methods you can work on a duplicate object.

Given a string & a clone of that string:

str = "abcd"
dup = str.dup
We get these results when we clear the duplicated string:

dup.clear
 
# str => "abcd"
# dup => ""
This keeps the original string safe.
